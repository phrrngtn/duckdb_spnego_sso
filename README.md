A **DuckDB C++ extension** that turns an **enterprise identity** — a JWT, or a
**Kerberos ticket** via SPNEGO — into **temporary, auto-rotating S3 credentials**, so
DuckDB `httpfs` reads/writes an S3-compatible store (AWS, MinIO, …) with **no static
access keys**. It registers an `sso` provider for the `s3` secret type:

```sql
-- Kerberos / SPNEGO: no password, no static keys — the OS ticket becomes S3 creds
CREATE SECRET lake (
  TYPE s3, PROVIDER sso,
  oidc_issuer  'https://keycloak.example/realms/lake',
  client_id    'minio',
  sts_endpoint 'https://minio.example:9000/',
  endpoint     'minio.example:9000', region 'us-east-1'
);

-- …or hand it a JWT you already hold (file / env / inline):
CREATE SECRET lake (TYPE s3, PROVIDER sso, token '<jwt>', sts_endpoint '…', endpoint '…');
```

Flow: **acquire a JWT** (inline `token` / `web_identity_token_file` / `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`
env / or **Kerberos SPNEGO** against an OIDC issuer) → **STS `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`**
(AWS STS or MinIO STS) → **temporary credentials** in a `KeyValueSecret` → `httpfs`
consumes them exactly like static keys, and they **auto-rotate** on expiry.

## Proof by construction: DuckDB-native SSO

sso is a working demonstration that enterprise **SSO → temporary S3 credentials** can
live entirely *inside* DuckDB — no client-side SDK, no static keys, no separate broker. The
whole identity → STS → S3 flow is a **SQL-loadable secret provider**, driven by ordinary SQL:

```sql
CREATE SECRET lake (
  TYPE s3, PROVIDER sso,
  oidc_issuer 'https://keycloak/realms/lake', client_id 'minio',
  sts_endpoint 'https://minio:9000/', endpoint 'minio:9000'
);
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('s3://lake/sales/*.parquet');
```

Because it's registered at the SQL layer, **any** DuckDB client gets SSO'd access to on-prem
MinIO for free — the CLI, Python, JDBC, and crucially **ODBC → Tableau / Power BI / Excel**:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  C1["CLI · Python · JDBC"] --> DDB
  C2["ODBC → Tableau / BI"] --> DDB
  DDB["DuckDB + sso<br/>CREATE SECRET … PROVIDER sso"]
  DDB -. "① pre-flight SPNEGO<br/>ambient kinit ticket — no browser" .-> KC["Keycloak / OIDC"]
  KC -. "JWT" .-> DDB
  DDB -. "② AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity" .-> STS["MinIO STS"]
  STS -. "temp creds" .-> DDB
  DDB ==>|"③ httpfs reads s3:// with temp creds"| M[("on-prem MinIO")]
```

**The linchpin is non-interactive auth.** A browser-based OIDC redirect is impossible from
Tableau or a raw ODBC connection. sso's **pre-flight SPNEGO** uses the caller's *ambient
Kerberos ticket* — no prompt, no redirect, no device code — so the whole SSO completes
silently inside `CREATE SECRET`. That is what turns "surface Kerberos-gated on-prem MinIO to
Tableau, keylessly" from impossible into a two-line SQL preamble.

What it proves, concretely:
- **No static keys** — credentials are short-lived STS tokens, auto-rotated (see [Refresh](#refresh--auto-rotation)).
- **No client SDK or broker** — the AWS-style web-identity → STS exchange lives in the extension, reachable from any language that can issue SQL.
- **No interactive step** — it runs headless, the hard requirement for BI tools and service accounts.

## Lightweight by design — no heavyweight dependencies

The goal is enterprise SSO-style auth with the **smallest possible footprint**. The
extension is a thin shim over the DuckDB host; it links **no** large libraries:

- **No HTTP library.** Every request — the STS POST, OIDC discovery, the SPNEGO
  auth-code GET, the token exchange — rides DuckDB's **core `HTTPUtil`** (the same HTTP
  abstraction `httpfs` implements, obtained via `HTTPUtil::Get(db)`). We *deliberately*
  reuse the host's HTTP stack instead of linking libcurl/cpr.
- **No JSON library.** OIDC discovery and token responses are read with a few lines of
  string scanning — the fields we need (`authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`,
  `access_token`) are simple, well-formed strings.
- **No XML library.** STS responses are parsed by pulling a handful of
  `<AccessKeyId>` / `<SecretAccessKey>` / `<SessionToken>` / `<Expiration>` tags directly.
- **No Kerberos/GSSAPI at link time.** The SPNEGO path **`dlopen`s** GSS-API
  (`libgssapi_krb5` on Linux, `GSS.framework` on macOS, SSPI on Windows) **at runtime**,
  and only when you use the `oidc_issuer` flow. The token/file/env paths touch no
  security library at all. The only link-time additions are the dl loader
  (`${CMAKE_DL_LIBS}`) and, on Windows, `secur32` for SSPI.

Net effect: the "real" work is one STS exchange plus an optional SPNEGO handshake —
everything else (HTTP, TLS, the S3 client) is borrowed from the DuckDB host.

## Why a C++ extension (the security API is not in the C interface)

sso **must** be C++. The DuckDB **secret-provider** surface —
`CreateSecretFunction`, `KeyValueSecret`, `RegisterSecretType`,
`ExtensionLoader::RegisterFunction`, and `HTTPUtil` — lives only in the **C++ core**.
It is **not** exposed through the stable **C extension API**: `duckdb.h` and
`duckdb_extension.h` contain **zero** `secret` symbols (verified at the header level),
whereas ordinary scalar-function registration *is* in the C API. So a stable-ABI,
version-independent C extension **cannot** register a secret provider — anything
security-related has to go through the C++ interface, which is why this is a C++
extension built against a pinned duckdb version.

## Token acquisition (the `sso` provider)

| Source | Parameters |
|---|---|
| Inline JWT | `token` |
| Token file | `web_identity_token_file` (or `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` env) |
| **Kerberos / SPNEGO** | `oidc_issuer`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uri`, `allow_http_negotiate` |

**Kerberos/SPNEGO** (`oidc_issuer` set): `kinit` ticket → `spnego::GenerateTokenForUrl`
(the dlopen'd GSS-API, from the shared [`spnego-token`](https://github.com/phrrngtn/spnego-token)
submodule) → OIDC discovery → proactive
`Authorization: Negotiate` auth-code GET → token exchange → JWT. The client's
`krb5.conf` should set **`dns_canonicalize_hostname = false`** so the requested SPN
matches the issuer host (`HTTP/<issuer-host>`) rather than a DNS-canonicalized name.

By default SPNEGO requires **HTTPS** (replay protection); `allow_http_negotiate true`
opts into plain HTTP when the transport is already encrypted by an overlay (e.g.
WireGuard/Tailscale).

## Scalar functions (preemptive Negotiate tokens)

The same [`spnego-token`](https://github.com/phrrngtn/spnego-token) atom is also exposed
as UDFs, so you can mint a token and drop it into any request — an `EXTRA_HTTP_HEADERS`
entry on a `TYPE http` secret, ad-hoc SQL, etc. All are `VOLATILE` (a fresh token per call).

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `negotiate_token(url)` | base64 SPNEGO token for `HTTP/<host>` (raises on failure) |
| `negotiate_token(url, service)` | token for `<service>/<host>` — `LDAP`, `cifs`, `host`, … |
| `negotiate_token_describe(url)` | a JSON diagnostics blob (SPN, provider, token-or-error); never raises |
| `negotiate_token_from_json(config)` | strict JSON property-bag `{"url"\|"host", "service", "allow_insecure"}` → token |

```sql
CREATE SECRET kerb (TYPE http, EXTRA_HTTP_HEADERS MAP {
    'Authorization': 'Negotiate ' || negotiate_token('https://intranet.example/')
});
```

## Refresh / auto-rotation

STS credentials are short-lived (minutes to ~an hour), so the provider is built to be
**re-runnable**, and the secret carries everything needed to re-run it:

- On creation, sso stores **all** the original `CREATE SECRET` options as a
  `refresh_info` struct inside the secret (alongside the temp creds and their
  `expiration`).
- When an S3 request fails because the credentials have expired, **httpfs**
  (`CreateS3SecretFunctions::TryRefreshS3Secret`) reconstructs the `CreateSecretInput`
  from `refresh_info`, calls `CreateSecret` again — which **re-invokes this provider** —
  and retries the S3 request with the fresh secret. No user action, no re-issuing
  `CREATE SECRET`.

What "re-invoke" actually does depends on the token source:

| Source | On refresh |
|---|---|
| `oidc_issuer` (Kerberos/SPNEGO) | **Full re-acquire** — new SPNEGO handshake → new JWT → new STS creds. Requires a still-valid Kerberos ticket (TGT) at refresh time. |
| `web_identity_token_file` | Re-reads the file → new STS creds. Works with an external token-rotation agent (e.g. an EKS/IRSA-style projected token). |
| inline `token` | Re-runs the STS call with the *same* JWT; only useful while that JWT is still valid — a static token cannot be renewed from inside the secret. |

Caveats, stated plainly:

- Refresh is **reactive**, not a proactive timer: it fires on an expired-credential
  failure and retries, so the first call after expiry pays one failed-then-retried
  round-trip. (The `expiration` is stored in the secret but sso does not itself run
  a background refresher.)
- For the SPNEGO path, refresh needs a **valid Kerberos ticket** when it runs. If the
  TGT has also expired, the refresh fails and you re-`kinit` — the long-lived secret of
  record is the Kerberos credential, not an S3 key.
- Verified end-to-end: re-invoking the provider yields a **different** `key_id` each
  time, confirming genuinely fresh STS credentials.

## Build, test, CI

- `make` builds against pinned **duckdb v1.5.4** + `extension-ci-tools` + the
  [`spnego-token`](https://github.com/phrrngtn/spnego-token) submodule (clone
  `--recursive` to also get its nested `nlohmann/json`); `make test` runs the suite. (`httpfs` is `INSTALL`/`LOAD`ed at test time, not compiled
  in — it supplies the s3 secret *type* and the `HTTPUtil` used for the STS call.)
- **GitHub Actions** builds the full distribution matrix (linux amd64/arm64, macOS
  amd64/arm64, windows mingw+MSVC, wasm). A **Forgejo** workflow additionally builds on
  self-hosted runners.

## Performance

In an enterprise setting the costs that matter are the auth handshake and the per-object
overhead of object storage — not the SQL engine. See
**[docs/sso Performance.md](docs/sso%20Performance.md)** for measured numbers
(one-time SSO ~230ms; ~8–12ms per S3 object open) and the layered mitigations that retire them
(DuckLake catalog for metadata, `cache_httpfs` for repeated data) — all driven by one keyless
`CREATE SECRET`, with `BLOBSSO_TIMING=1` for the per-step breakdown.

For the broader architecture this enables — out-of-band catalog writes and zero-copy facets over
on-prem object storage (cloud→on-prem data repatriation, governed by SSO reads) — see
**[docs/Disaggregated Lakehouse.md](docs/Disaggregated%20Lakehouse.md)**.
